    "__Missing Data:__ Currently, the bias of critics/users is not shown and by discovering this potential bias, a greater understanding of the quality of video games can be found.\n",

    "### __Privacy and Security__\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Data Privacy of Source:__ Kaggle needs to protect the information on their site from potential data hacks to ensure data accuracy, and safety. Kaggle must also ensure that a user's data is not leaked while using the site and that download files are not malicious software.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Application Data Privacy:__ There is no personal data contained within the data I have sourced and there is no way to identify an individual from the data I am using alone. If I were to release this application to the general public I would have a responsibility to ensure that user data is not leaked while using the application and that the data is protected and cannot be tampered with.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Cyber Security:__ An Application should have secure data encryption (which means that the data is scrambled and changed so that it can not be read without a key) that is backed up on a regular basis to ensure that data cannot be corrupted. User authentication (the process in which a person is verified to be who they claim to be. This can be in the form of a password or pin) should be used to ensure that confidentiality and user data is protected. Password hashing (the process of turning a password into an unrecognisable script once entered) should also be used to prevent information being stolen in the event of a data breach.\n",
