    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Purpose:__ The purpose of analysing the ratings of Nintendo games from Users and Critics over the past 20 years is to determine if there is any bias towards genre in either category and if Critics in general give higher ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Missing Data:__ Currently, the bias of critics/users is not shown and by discovering this potential bias, a greater understanding of the quality of video games can be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Stakeholders:__ Consumers will benefit from this information as it will allow them to determine if a game is actually worth buying, in spite of reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Use:__ Consumers will be able to bias towards certain genres, and gain a deeper understanding of how higher ratings don’t necessarily indicate a better game and be educated on potential bias towards future games.\n",
    "\n",
    "### __Privacy and Security__\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Data Privacy of Source:__ Kaggle needs to protect the information on their site from potential data hacks to ensure data accuracy, and safety. Kaggle must also ensure that a user's data is not leaked while using the site and that download files are not malicious software.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Application Data Privacy:__ There is no personal data contained within the data I have sourced and there is no way to identify an individual from the data I am using alone. If I were to release this application to the general public I would have a responsibility to ensure that user data is not leaked while using the application and that the data is protected and cannot be tampered with.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Cyber Security:__ An Application should have secure data encryption (which means that the data is scrambled and changed so that it can not be read without a key) that is backed up on a regular basis to ensure that data cannot be corrupted. User authentication (the process in which a person is verified to be who they claim to be. This can be in the form of a password or pin) should be used to ensure that confidentiality and user data is protected. Password hashing (the process of turning a password into an unrecognisable script once entered) should also be used to prevent information being stolen in the event of a data breach.\n",
